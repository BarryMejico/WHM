                   <p>1.	What would be the advantages of being part of the smart city?
                        A smart city is a safer city. Leveraging technology advances and pursuing private/public partnerships help reduce criminal activity. Technologies such as license plate recognition, gunshot detectors, connected crime centers, next-generation 911, and body cameras all give law enforcement an edge while on the job.

                        2.	What are the possible key issues of smart cities?
                        •	Privacy and Security. The idea of monitoring or controlling our environment is a significant fear for many people. ...
                        •	Data Issues. Another smart city challenge stems from the massive amounts of data that must be constantly collected, analyzed and shared.
                        •	Governance and Funding.

                        3.	If the government provides much of the money required to implement a smart city, would it be successful? Why and Why not?
                        Unfortunately, many city leaders are finding that the direct adoption of an innovation from one city to another does not guarantee the creation of public value. It would not guarantee the best service offered by technology. It would cost much of funding. If there’s no source of electricity, technology won’t work.

                        4.	For what reason do you think our country cannot adopt smart cities?
                        The Philippines is one of the poor countries in Asia. We cannot afford to maintain such an innovation.

                        5.	Aside from mobile phones, how can we bridge the digital divide?
                        There are top Five Digital Divide Solutions
